		 <h2><ins>History of Arsenal</ins></h2>
		 
		 
		 
		 
		 <p>Arsenal FC started life as a works team named Dial Square in 1886. Shortly thereafter, the club turned professional and changed its name to Woolwich Arsenal, becoming a full-fledged member of the Football League in 1893 (the first club from the south parts of the country). 
		 The following period was fraught with difficulties for the club; besides not being able to form a team that could challenge for the title, Jim was geographically isolated from the rest of the league, which resulted in low attendances. After teetering dangerously close to bankruptcy, the club was bought out by businessman Henry Norris in 1910 and moved to North London in 1913 (Highbury became the new home ground). 
		 The following year, the club was renamed to Arsenal.</p>
